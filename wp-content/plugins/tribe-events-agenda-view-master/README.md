The Events Calendar: Agenda View
======================

This plugin adds an agenda view to your The Event Calendar suite by Modern Tri.be.

We created this plugin as a guideline to help you create fully functional new views for The Events Calendar plugin that get properly integrated with the plugins settings, views, and other important bits. We have tried to include as much useful comments in the code as documentation for creating your own addon plugin and views for The Event Calendar.
